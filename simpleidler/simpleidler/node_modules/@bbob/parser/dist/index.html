Rose-colored boy

I hear you making all that noise
                              [ch]C[/ch]
About the world you want to see

Hearts are breaking, Wars are raging on
               [ch]C[/ch]
And I have taken my glasses off

I want you to stop insisting that I'm not a lost cause
                              [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause I've been through a lot
                                         [ch]Dm[/ch]
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
[ch]C[/ch]
If it's all right by you

My rose-colored boy

[ch]Bb[/ch]
Leave me here a little bit longer
                            [ch]C[/ch]
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
[ch]Bb[/ch]
You say "We gotta look on the bright side"
                                  [ch]C[/ch]
I say "Well maybe if you wanna go blind"
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind

Tuning: Standard

Intro: [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] 4x

Verse:
[ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
You hurt me bad this time, no coming back
[ch]F#m[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
And I cry 'till I couldn't cry, another heart attack
[ch]F#m[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up
[ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
And I don't pick up when you call
  [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause your voice is a gun
[ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Every word is a bullet hole
Shot a hole in the sun
 [ch]F#m[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
If I never look up maybe I'll never notice


Chorus:
     [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
And you, you want forgiveness
    [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
But I, I just can't do it yet

Verse:
[ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
   [ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line
   [ch]F#m[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
If I follow it down would we just be alright?
   [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
But it could take me all your life to learn to love
           [ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
How I thought I could love someone
 [ch]G[/ch]
I haven't even begun
[ch]F#m[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
If it's all up to us we might as well give up


Chorus:
[ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And you, you want forgiveness
[ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
(I can barely hang on to myself)
[ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
But I, I can't give you that
[ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
[ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And you, you want forgiveness
[ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
[ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
But I, I just can't do it yet
[ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

Interlude: [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] 4x

Bridge:
[ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Don't you go and get it twisted
[ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Forgiving is not forgetting
[ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
Don't you go and get it twisted
[ch]A[/ch]
Forgiving is not forgetting
        [ch]A[/ch]
No, it's not forgetting
         [ch]A[/ch]
No, I'll never forget it, no

Do Chorus
And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

      [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
I dove in again ’cause I’m not into giving up
                     [ch]F[/ch]
Could’ve gotten the same rush from any lover’s touch
            [ch]C[/ch]
Why get used to something new?
              [ch]G[/ch]
‘Cause no one breaks my heart like you

Verse :
[ch]F[/ch]
And you kiss me, and you wish we could see what happens next
[ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
For a moment, I can forget what happens in my head
[ch]F[/ch]
If I doubt you, will you come through with a happy second chance?
[ch]C[/ch]
A happy ending
[ch]G[/ch]
But this time you don’t leave me sinking

Chorus:
[ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
I’m underwater

My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
[ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
You are the wave
I could never tame
[ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
If I survive
I’ll dive back in

As if the first blood didn’t thrill enough
          [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
I went further out to see what else was left of us
                    [ch]F[/ch]
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
           [ch]C[/ch]
Drain the fantasy of you
       [ch]G[/ch]
Headfirst into shallow pools

[ch]F[/ch]
And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
 [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
[ch]F[/ch]
If you’re really sorry
                     [ch]C[/ch]
Happy second chance, I think I could forgive
[ch]G[/ch]
This time you won’t leave me sinking

Right back into

Strange how we found ourselves exactly where we left off
                 [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
I know you’re shaking my hand like it is the first time
 [ch]G[/ch]
Are we alright?

Refrain:
            [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Are you recounting all my faults?
 [ch]A[/ch]
And are you racking your brain just to find them all?
         [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
Could it be that I’ve changed or did you?

Chorus:
[ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Stop asking why
               [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Why we had to waste so much time
                [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again

‘Cause we can’t keep holding on to grudges

Time is a bastard I won’t break my neck to get around it
                 [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
But aren’t we so brave to give up a fight
              [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And let the years go by without us

Refrain:
[ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
‘Cause now I feel you by my side

Why we had to waste so much time

Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again

[Intro]
[ch]D#[/ch] [ch]D/Bb[/ch]
[Verse 1]
[ch]D#[/ch]
Standing here like I'm supposed to say something
[ch]D/Bb[/ch]
Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey
[ch]G#[/ch]
And I don't want your money. If I was you, I'd run from me
   [ch]Gm[/ch]                            [ch]A#[/ch]
or rip me open. You'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless.
[ch]D#[/ch]
Be sure to put your faith in something more
[ch]D/Bb[/ch]
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
[ch]G#[/ch]
We all got problems, don't we? We all need heroes, don't we?
[ch]Gm[/ch]                               [ch]A#[/ch]
But rest assured, there's not a single person here who's worthy

   Hey baby, I'm not your superhuman
[ch]D#[/ch]                      [ch]A#[/ch]
And if that's what you want

I hate to let you down
  [ch]D#[/ch]               [ch]A#[/ch]
I got your hopes up
  [ch]D#[/ch]              [ch]G#[/ch]
Now I got you hoping
    [ch]D#[/ch]           [ch]A#[/ch]    [ch]D#[/ch]
That I'm gonna be the one to let you down


[Verse 2]
[ch]D#[/ch]
Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
[ch]D/Bb[/ch]
Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
[ch]G#[/ch]
What if I fall on my face? What if I make a mistake?
[ch]Gm[/ch]                       [ch]A#[/ch]
If it's okay a little grace would be appreciated
[ch]D#[/ch]
Remember how we used to like ourselves?
[ch]D/Bb[/ch]
What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred
[ch]G#[/ch]
I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape ya
[ch]Gm[/ch]                         [ch]A#[/ch]
But we can let the light illuminate these hopeless places

[Pre-Chorus]

La, la la la la la la

Just let me let you down

You're wasting all your faith on me
[ch]Cm[/ch]                   [ch]A#[/ch]
Oh, no, I know where this goes
[ch]D#[/ch]                            [ch]G#[/ch]
They can say, they say, your savior doesn't look a thing like me

11.     "No Friend"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]G#[/ch] [ch]Gm[/ch] ( all througout)

These old letters from years ago
I felt it was leading to a
[...]
When I wrote this [...] I may have been finally able to address how it feels

Another brick-red room,
Another black-top town,
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down,
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray,

Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed,
Another song that runs too long god knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot!

Dance beneath another burning sky,
Behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection
You project on me

When this repetition ends behind the window shades,
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made,
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambition win again

I'd hate to let you down
So I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection
In the naïve expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part,
Back when I felt most free,
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me

So before the regiment resumes,
Before the dreaded sun appears,
My driver's waiting
So let's make one point crystal clear:

You see a flood-lit form,
I see a shirt design,
I'm no savior of yours
And you're no friend of mine.

You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

You see a flood-lit form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours
And you're no friend of mine

I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realising what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I hate I might actually be more afraid
[...] I feel like they know the story
I saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
Jumped in and grabbed the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful

I know you think that I erased you

Just starting something new again
             [ch]Am7[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
I'm getting sick of the beginnings
    [ch]Am7[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
And always coming to your defences
              [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]BbM7[/ch]
I guess it's good to get it off my chest
             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]BbM7[/ch]
I guess I can't believe I haven't yet
 [ch]Am7[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
You know I got my own convictions
[ch]Am7[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]

Take me down with your quiet
  [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]Gm[/ch]
Of all the weapons you fight with

Your silence is the most violent

In the wild fog of your memory
You don't have to tell me
I can still believe
